My basic goals:
random order of flashcards
asks question with key (input)
if user wants answer they can input the command "next"
then the program asks if they got the value as the answer(answer y/n)
if the user got a similar answer they input y and the yes counter goes up
if no is selected, the count will go down
yes counter corrosponds to different boxes
counter = 0 has a 100% chance counter = 1 has a 80% chance of appearing, etc etc, eventually if counter = 5, the question will not appear

Extra:
User inputs how many flashcards they want
User inputs keys and values for dictionary
save
